To get it up and running, run:

    rake db:migrate db:seed 

This will run the migrations and seed your database with the data that is in the seeds.rb file. 

Then run

    rails s
    
to get the server running and go to 

    localhost:3000/wines

in your brower (let me guess you're using Crome).

Have fun!
